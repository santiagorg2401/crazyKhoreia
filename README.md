# crazyKhoreia
## Brief description.
crazyKhoreia is a robotic perception system intended for UAVs (aka drones), which takes a digital image and converts it into a waypoint matrix using X, Y and Z coordinates in meters for UAVs choreography design.
## How does it work?
crazyKhoreia takes a digital image and uses a vectorizing technic based on openCV [findContours](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d3/dc0/group__imgproc__shape.html#ga17ed9f5d79ae97bd4c7cf18403e1689a) algorithm to obtain contours, then, it gets waypoints from those contours, after that, depending on the usage mode (either lightPainting or multi-UAV formation), it optimizes the waypoints and finds a feasible 2D path travelling through **all** of them, minimizing the total travelled distance, thus, the flight duration (assuming constant speed).


### Light painting mode (class lightPainting)
Light painting is a photography technic consisting on capturing a long exposure photograph using a moving light source, the light source's movement creates an effect on the camera sensor which captures its trail, therefore, it "paints" all over the camera's frame, creating a painting optical effect.

### Multi UAV formation mode (to be implemented)
A multi UAV formation is made by several UAVs grouped together in patterns to construct a figure visible with a naked eye. It's been used by companies such as [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/technology-innovation/intel-drone-light-shows.html) or [DSS](https://droneshowsoftware.com) to create terrific light shows performed by UAVs like the Super Bowl's half-time shows.

## Usage.
crazyKhoreia's usage it's pretty straightforward, you'll only need a digital image and a few parameters:

| Parameter | Usage mode | Class | Description | Data type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MAX_WIDTH | all | [lightPainting](https://github.com/santiagorg2401/crazyKhoreia/blob/e36bff07f4cf89e3d0205c949ff4bd80f890110e/src/crazyKhoreia/lightPainting.py#L17) | Maximum workspace width. | float

|out_path|light painting | [lightPainting](https://github.com/santiagorg2401/crazyKhoreia/blob/e36bff07f4cf89e3d0205c949ff4bd80f890110e/src/crazyKhoreia/lightPainting.py#L17) | Files output path. | str

Take into account that lightPainting class creates an instance of the crazyKhoreia class in its constructor method.

To run the program, create an instance of the lightPainting class.
```console
lp = lightPainting(MAX_WIDTH, MAX_HEIGHT, MIN_WIDTH, MIN_HEIGHT, in_path, out_path, detail=0.05, speed=1.0, sleepTime=0.1, video=False, led=False)
```

After its execution you'll notice the output files within the set output path.
